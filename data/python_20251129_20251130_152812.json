      "body": "I have created a [plugin for mypy ](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/mypy-pure)that checks the presence of \"impure\" functions (functions with side-effects) in user functions. I've leveraged the use of AI for it (mainly for the AST visitor part). The main issue is that there are some controversies about the potential use of copyrighted code in the learning datasets of the LLMs.\n\nI've set the project to MIT license but I don't mind user other license, or even putting the code in public domain (it's just an experiment). I've also introduced a disclaimer about the use of LLMs in the project.\n\nHere I have some questions:\n\n* What do you do in this case? Avoid LLMs completely? Ask them about their sources of data? I'm based in Europe (Spain, concretely).\n* Does PyPI have any policy about LLM-generated code?\n* Would this be a handicap with respect to the adoption of a library?",

      "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve just released **SentinelNav**, a pure Python tool that creates interactive spectral maps of binary files to visualize their internal \"geography.\" It runs entirely on the standard library (no `pip install` required).\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nAnalyzing raw binary files (forensics, reverse engineering, or file validation) is difficult because:\n\n* **Hex Dumps are dense:** Reading 50MB of hex code to find where a text section ends and an encrypted payload begins is mentally exhausting and slow.\n* **Pattern Recognition:** It is hard to distinguish between compressed data, random noise, and machine code just by looking at values.\n* **Dependency Hell:** Many existing visualization tools require heavy GUI frameworks (Qt) or complex environment setups just to perform a quick check.\n\n**The Solution: SentinelNav**\n\nI built a deterministic engine that transforms binary data into visual clusters:\n\n* **Spectral Mapping:** It maps byte values to RGB colors. High-bit bytes (compiled code/media) appear Red, printable ASCII appears Green, and nulls/padding appear Blue. This allows you to visually identify file headers and sections instantly.\n* **Architecture Heuristics:** It scans raw binary chunks to detect headers (PE, ELF, Mach-O) and attempts to guess the CPU architecture (x86 vs ARM64) based on instruction alignment and opcode frequency.\n* **Entropy Analysis:** It calculates Shannon entropy per block to detect anomalies, such as \"Flux events\" where data transitions from structured to random (encryption boundaries).\n\n**Example / How to Run**\n\nSince it relies on the standard library, it works out of the box:\n\n    # No dependencies to install\n    python3 sentinelnav.py my_firmware.bin\n\nThis spawns a local web server. You can then open your browser to:\n\n1. Navigate the file map using **WASD** keys (like a game).\n2. Click colored blocks to inspect the **Hex Dump** and **ArchID** analysis.\n3. Export the visualization as a **.BMP** image.\n\n**Target Audience** Reverse Engineers, CTF players, Security Analysts, and developers interested in file structures.\n\n**Comparison**\n\n* **Binwalk:** Great for extraction, but lacks interactive visualization.\n* **Veles / Cantordust:** Powerful but often unmaintained or require complex installations.\n* **SentinelNav:** Focuses on being lightweight, zero-dependency, and \"drop-and-run\" compatible with any system that has Python 3 installed.\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\n* **Concurrency:** Uses `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` to crunch entropy math across all CPU cores.\n* **Data Handling:** Uses an ephemeral `sqlite3` database to index analysis chunks, allowing it to paginate through files larger than available RAM.\n* **Frontend:** A custom HTML5 Canvas rendering engine embedded directly in the Python script.\n* **Repo:** [https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav](https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav)",

So I started to build myself a pantry manager. This quickly escalated big time and now I have a fully modular homehub with different apps and widgets. There definetelly are still some errors every now and then. Specifically when it comes to the interface. It is intended to run on a tablet or like py with touchscreen and it will become more touch friendly in the future but for now there are some cool features:\n\n\\- it is multi lingual  \n\\- it somewhat supports different resolutions (This will come I am just tired for today)  \n\\-the pantry manager just needs a barcode and pulls the rest from the internet  \n\\-there is homeassistant integration I have never tested, since I don't have home assistant (I really don't know why I did this, Dream big I guess)  \n\\-A Taskboard  \n\\-A simple calender and calendar widget  \n\\-A clock (Revolutionary I know)\n\nPlanned features:  \n\\- Spotify and Airplay integration (I have airplay speakers and want to use them via my homehub)  \n\\- Leaving notes behind (Hand scribbled not keyboard typed)  \n\\- Make the grocery feature better (maybe telegram or whatsapp integretion)  \n\\- And anything I will think of in the future (or maybe one of you thinks of)\n\n**Comparison With Other Solutions:**\n\nI focused on extrem modularity.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nWell anyone with an unused windows or linux tablet/touchscreen/computer who has a strange obsession with order (might require a barcode scanner)\n\nFor now thank you for reading this far. Sorry for my terrible english (My brain hurts) and I hope you check out my little project.\n\nHave a nice evening\n\nGrefendor",

I think this risk outweighs the possible (but [not guaranteed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09089)) time-saving benefits of AI.\n* AI models might inadvertently spit out large copies of copyleft code; thus, if I incorporated these into my programs, I might then need to release the entire program under a similar copyleft license. This would be frustrating for hobby projects and a potential nightmare for professional ones.\n* I find the experience of writing my own code very fulfilling, and I imagine that using AI might take [some of that fulfillment away](https://colton.dev/blog/curing-your-ai-10x-engineer-imposter-syndrome/#its-okay-to-be-less-productive).\n* LLMs rely on huge amounts of human-generated code and text in order to produce their output. Thus, even if these tools become ubiquitous, I think there will always be a need (and demand) for programmers who can write code without AI--both for training models and for fixing those models' mistakes.\n* As Ed Zitron has pointed out, generative AI tools are losing tons of money at the moment, so in order to survive, they will most likely need to steeply increase their rates or offer a worse experience. This would be yet another reason not to rely on them in the first place. (On a related note, I try to use free and open-source tools as much as possible in order to avoid getting locked into proprietary vendors' products. This gives me another reason to avoid generative AI tools, as most, if not all of them, don't appear to fall into the FOSS category.)\n* Unlike calculators, compilers, interpreters, etc., generative AI tools are non-deterministic. If I can't count on them to produce the exact same output given the exact same input, I don't want to make them a central part of my workflow.\n\nI am fortunate to work in a setting where the choice to use AI is totally optional. If my supervisor ever required me to use AI, I would most likely start to do so--as having a job is more important to me than maintaining a particular approach. However, even then, I think the time I spent learning and writing Python without AI would be well worth it--as, in order to evaluate the code AI spits out, it is very helpful, and perhaps crucial, to know how to write that same code yourself. (And I would continue to use an AI-free approach for my own hobby projects.)\n\n",

The code to feed LLMs as training data will mostly be generated by LLMs based on what already existed. It will drown out the high quality code, reducing the quality of LLM generated code as it is just rehashed code upon rehashed decades old code.\n\nThis is already a problem.

The problem is with the limitations of the transformer architecture itself and expectations exceeding those limitations.\n\n\nModel collapse is a real problem, but relying on one architecture and one source, like SO,\u00a0 for data extraction isnt a valid solution to that problem.\n\n\nIts become obvious that throwing more data at a model is not a proper solution. As a result, data limitations are not a problem.\n\n\ne.g. There are many model components like mlp, cnn, rnn, attn, etc that constitute what might a model be. llms are just a single arch with some of these components.\n\n\nI personally dont consider SO, reddit, or other forums to be \"high quality\" data. Theyre just acessible, user driven, content forums.\u00a0What is \"high quality\" is subjective.\n\n\nOverall, content generation isnt going anywhere.

It's also the most advanced AI we have at the moment. Saying it's not a problem isn't really helping anything since general AI is still a mirage we're stumbling after and realizing we're not quite there yet.\n\nYour conclusion that \"data limitations are not a problem\" does not follow from the acknowledgment that throwing more data at transformers has hit the point of diminishing returns. \"data limitations\" are limitations until we come up with a better solution than throwing exponentially more data at it for marginal improvements.\n\nI didn't specify what \"high quality data\" was. I used that in contrast to data generated by AIs. It is not high quality since it doesn't add anything new to the data set, only reinforces the data that was used to generate it. It ossifies the existing training data, it does no improve it. Hence, it is low quality. This is an objective assessment since it is duplicative of the data used to generate it.\n\nNo...I don't think it's going any where. We will recognize it's limitations and I believe work to filter it out of training data since AI generated data adds no value to AI training and has real downsides such as artificially reinforcing the original data sets biases.\n\n\"Its not a sustainable or sane path.

In this case, it usually is a better internet search, because the built in \"reasoning\" process will query a bunch of sites for information, process that, search some more, process that, then summarize its findings. \n\nThese models do hallucinate for sure, but in my experience it's typically on more obscure topics or areas with less documentation/articles written. That said, this hallucination is still useful as a starting point, even if woefully incorrect. I'll read its sources and go from there etc.",

I've gotten a lot of garbage even for basic questions. eg, I tested Cursor out at some point on a toy project just to see how it worked and was initially massively disappointed in the result. The quality of its answers were unexpectedly bad, but then I realized that it was using a standard model instead of a reasoning/thinking one, and after switching to that, the results were on par with my expectations. \n\nBroadly, my point is that in my experience the reasoning models are a lot more capable and less likely to hallucinate, and even when they do hallucinate (and they definitely do), their answers provide useful citations that are a starting point for my own research. It's ability to collate a lot of resources quickly is incredibly useful.",

It wrote some code, I iterated some changes on top, but ultimately got the animations I needed to illustrate patterns in student test scores.\u00a0\n\n\nTo me, the important part wasn't taking pride in my code, it was getting a working animation that helped intuitively convey the state testing score scale or trajectory of scores based on previous data. Not spending extra hours on it to make it happen, that allowed me to work on other parts of the presentation.\n\n\nMatplotlib is an incredible tool, but I don't use it regularly and, even when I was using it in college, it was never exactly something that was easy to pick up and run with. I could Google my way to building working graphs and whatnot, but AI has really helped me utilize the more advanced features and I've absolutely learned *how* these things work since going through the code.

They confidently tell you this option was added from a specific version. When told that these options don't exist it simply hallucinates new ones with different names.\n\nThis same question is easily and correctly answered with a 30 second google and a quick read of the relevant docs sections and anyone working in the domain could probably tell you the answer without looking anyway. \n\nSo yeah... these AI are absolutely not better than just being competent at using Google.",

          "body": "There are good and bad ways to use AI as a programmer.\n\nSome bad ways:\n\n- using it to code you something you don\u2019t understand very well. EG, a few months ago I started working on react having spent my entire career as a backend dev and data engineer in python. I tried using an LLM to build me some features in a frontend pet project. I couldn\u2019t instruct it very well, and I also couldn\u2019t tell if it was making bad decisions. The result was total garbage.\n- setting it long running tasks with minimal supervision. I ran an experiment where I gave an LLM a set of prompts for another LLM tool, a companion set of validated database queries, and a function that executed a sql query against a database. I gave it the instruction to improve the prompt until it generated queries that returned the same results as the validated queries. It consistently failed to do anything useful after several long running attempts, at the end of each it smugly announced that it had achieved perfect scores (it actually had achieved 0/10 each time). I had better results in about 5 minutes of prompt optimization.\n\nGood ways:\n\n- asking targeted specific questions about a narrow scope (a single function, a line in a function), in a file and project that has been programmed by capable senior devs.\n- knowing the subject area of your question well enough to know the answer is good or bad.\n- writing unit tests for code written by humans, again in a project with existing tests, fixtures, etc. that can be provided as examples.\n\nOne thing to note, after my initial escapades with frontend code and LLMs, I actually got a job as a full stack dev on a typescript project (unrelated to those escapades), and I made a conscious choice to avoid using coding assistants for several months so that I could force my brain to learn the patterns of this project and language. That was crucial to me being able to now use coding assistants to help me without getting rejected at code review (I work with a very bright but extremely tyrannical principle dev).\n\nThe good examples are not reliably good, but they are structured in such a way that this is inherently obvious to you as the user.\n\nFor the unit tests, I normally find that it gets them about 80% of the way there. Most of the tests will initially fail, due to a few bugs in the test code, and sometimes tests will be meaningless or will pass when they should fail. Note that I know these things because I sit and read through the test file generated from beginning to end.\n\nThe result is that it does save me time versus writing the tests from scratch, but it\u2019s more like it cuts down the time by about 30%. But that\u2019s still worth it, at least to me.",

A key to using AI tools effectively is the ability to validate the answers it provides, and you need to build your own foundation of experience to be able to do that.\n\nWhat you should learn is how to ask questions of the tool and interrogate its answers. Ask it why it did something, and try to see if its answer makes sense, then refer to documentation etc. I also suggest switching away from your base models to the \"reasoning\" models like o3, as these in my experience are a lot better at searching/collating information from several resources, leading to less overall hallucination.",

          "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nThank you for the comments and feedback! A few follow-up thoughts:\n\n1. Yes, I probably discounted generative AI's functionality as a search engine. It sounds like it could be useful in that regard. However, I generally try to get answers via official documentation, so simply entering stuff like \"ANSI encode decode site:python.org\" into DuckDuckGo works quite well for me.\n\n2. I recognize the possibility that not using AI could be a career liability down the road. However, as mentioned in my original post, I'm absolutely open to using gen AI if my employer were to require it. I figure that waiting until then would still be worth it, since (1) my own programming abilities would have continued to develop along the way; (2) the gen AI landscape may have changed so much by then that current AI tools might be obsolete by then anyway; and (3) I don't think it will take terribly long to learn how to use them.\n\n3. Commenters have also compared my approach to not using the Internet. Two thoughts here. First, I still see a major difference between human-generated code and content, which the internet and web searches make much more accessible, and AI summaries of such content. (The original sources that AI models ingest seem far more useful to me than the summarized output.) Second, I actually do think that learning programming via physical books is underrated and a great foundation for future programming. \n\n4. I truly did not mean for the original post to come off as a flex--and I don't think it represents one. I mean, what I'm describing is how everyone programmed before gen AI tools became available a few years ago; there's nothing special or extraordinary about it. I simply wanted to see if others were continuing to hold off on AI tools, and it looks like there are at least a few others in that camp :)\n\n5. Finally: it sounds like very few, if any of you, are using generative AI to write large amounts of your code--let alone replace any programmers with it. It's probably not a representative sample, but if that's the case, I imagine that the investors who have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into these tools might be left disappointed. A nicer web search is handy, but is that really going to make people whole on their GPU investments?",

          "body": "So, my initial reaction when someone asks me, \"do you use AI for coding?\" is to look disgusted and think \"No! Do you think I'm an idiot?\" The problem is that \"AI for coding\" often gets mixed up with the whole \"vibe coding\" bullshit, which has objectively proven to be for idiots who don't understand what coding is, or how it works, or what it's for.   \n  \nWhen I get deeper into it, yes, I do use local LLMs to help me talk about coding choices, or to explore new APIs or come up with libraries as I'm starting to sketch something out - and actually, short of having an experienced partner next to me, or at the other end of a chat, it's a pretty good sounding-board to help develop, finess or otherwise structure an idea.\n\nIf one of my devs submitted vibe-coded content into our shared work repository, I would be watching them \\*very\\* closely, and, unless there was a good reason not to, be considering firing them from the team. \n\nSo, it depends on what you exactly mean by \"AI for programming\" - the points you raise are exactly right - if you use it \\*instead\\* of stretching your skills, guess-what? You'll have no skills and deserve to be fired. But, if you use it to help round out and refine your ideas, I think that can be a really good alternative to doing the same thing with a real human who's got the expertise. Failing that, stack overflow (which is where the AI's seem to be getting much of their content anyway) will usually be an equally good backup, it's what we've all been using for the last 10 years, anyway.",

I don't accept either one blindly, I check the merits of each and cherry pick the best of the suggestions. \n\nI've used so many different technologies during my tech career. I can't retain all that I learned. Gen AI is good at finding fragments from various publications and stitching the bits together that are relevant to my question. It isn't always correct but it is generally in the right direction. \n\nWhen I see it used for OCR coupled with text to speech and even translations, it opens up a whole new world for dyslexics and people with visual impairment.  Text to speech helps visually impaired programmers. If Chris McCausland had this tech when his sight degraded he might have been able to continue a career in tech.

For example, our results are consistent with small greenfield projects or development in unfamiliar codebases seeing substantial speedup from AI assistance.\n\nAI-specific factors - We expect that AI systems that have higher fundamental reliability, lower latency, and/or are better elicited (e.g. via more inference compute/tokens, more skilled prompt ing/scaffolding, or explicit fine-tuning on repositories) could speed up developers in our setting (i.e. experienced open-source developers on large repositories)\n\n  \nEdit - someone below pointed out this isn't about learning.  Here is a recent paper more on topic: [Search+Chat: Integrating Search and GenAI to Support Users with Learning-oriented Search Tasks](https://ils.unc.edu/~jarguell/YangCHIIR2025.pdf)",

Sometimes it's a little too confident even when it's wrong and sometimes it takes some debugging, but the workflow is much faster, even if you just use it to write comments or make nice function headers, it can rally take out some of the tedious tasks. It can even do great if you give it code and say find logic and syntax errors.",

Doubly so if you're thinking about frameworks, anyone remember Java Server Faces? WCF?  Silverlight? Lol.\n\nThe best way is to learn to start from zero. Be good at zero.

Work at a job without worrying about leetcode for your next one.\n\nWill you have to leetcode for your next one? Depending on when it is, maybe not. AI is already ripping that process to shreds. Leetcode was never an effective interview process, GenAI makes it worse. Learn how to learn. Read books. Understand product design and requirements gathering. Build systems with vendor dependence and support in mind. Learn to lean on other programmers...and by that same stretch AI. The age of the cowboy coder was over 20 years ago.",

Recently after a few years of being a former Developer who works in an IT Helpdesk for similar pay as my last programming gig. I have come into an abundance of free time and have decided to rebuild my portfolio and build/rebuild a handful of projects for it. \n\nAt some point during the last week or so I have started to learn how to work with AI assistance in my workflow. It honestly reminds me of the best aspects of having a good colleague/mentor to go to when you have questions. I view the code that it generates as a stripped down bare bones example like you would send to a friend who is struggling. Even better part of the explanations that some LLM pair with the code examples help give you something to search in greater depth if you really want to learn what is going on.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it is, a lot of times in the past I would find a library I wanted to incorporate into my code read the description and README off of github. Using AI allows you to pose questions than generate a page like the README files on github tailored to your specific issue with descriptions and examples. \n\nIf that README style page is written by the developer or an AI tailored to your problem the only way to truly understand what a library on github is doing is to read the source for yourself. \n\nI mean you are asking the LLM for help and advice not to make you redundant....right",

          "body": "It is a good idea not to use Gen AI to write code you for. You can learn code by yourself. \n\nSimilarly to use LLM for coding, people begin to learn Python as their first programming language instead of learning a low level language like C or C++. This is easy way but it limits your grows to be a good software engineer. Python is so easy and has many well build packages already. Hence, mostly we don't need to implement advanced library by ourselves. We just need to call them to solve a problem and build an application. This makes engineer's life easier but nothing left to have a high competing power in a job market. \n\nIf you are not and do not want to be a software engineer, you can keep learning Python. Otherwise, I don't recommend to learn Python even if you want to do it by yourself and without using LLM. Go and find a low level language. The languages in my suggestions include Rust. Rust is not easy to learn, but it is highly powerful and futuristic. \n\nAlso, to learn Rust or any other low-level languages efficiently, I recommend you to utilize a chat bot or an any Agentic AI tool. Rust is too hard to learn as a beginner from the scrach. However, if you use chat bot or agent coding tool, it will be very helpful to learn  Rust or other low-level language to learn them quicker and easier. Even this approach can be used when you learn Python. I suggest you not to ask AI to generate everything but ask AI to help to write your code and review your code. Ask LLM to optimize your code in terms of speed, it will help you have wider view in programming. \n\nIn short, I suggest two approaches while you are going to leave from using Gen AI tool for your coding. First, I suggest you not to stick to learn Python but try to find and study other low-level language to be a really good software engineer. Second, regardless of languages, I recommend you to use AI to improve your language skill in a different way to the current approach.",

I've been programming for four decades and I can tell you I haven't been as productive nor have I enjoyed programming so much in a long time. A lot of programming is grunt work and AI can do a lot of that for you. I don't trust AI. My workflow is something like asking it to write a function that does X (sometimes a module) and then I read and understand \\*every\\* line of code. Sometimes I found a bit of crap code that repeats logic in different places or does something overly complicated, so I edit it (or sometimes ask the AI to edit it). It's like working with a junior engineer that you must supervise closely.\n\nIt's also surprisingly good to have discussions about organizing/refactoring code with AI.",

This Integrated Development Environment (IDE) featured autocompletion for HTML tags. I was hesitant to use it because I was afraid it would erode my abilities as a web developer; I worried I would forget the HTML tags.\n\nFast-forward to 2025, and we have powerful AI tools. Similar concerns are now being raised about the possibility of losing the ability to debug or code without relying on AI.\n\nI don't know if these two situations are 100% comparable, but I would argue that blindly using any tool\u2014be it AI, an IDE, or Stack Overflow\u2014will ultimately erode human capacity.\n\nConsider the history of programming. People began coding using punched cards, writing every line of code from memory. Then, high-level languages replaced assembly languages. Can we argue that these advancements destroyed the human ability to code from memory or the ability to write assembly languages?\n\nAI is simply another tool in the line of technological evolution. The key is to use it wisely\u2014don't use it blindly.",

You can be the person that does not need AI but no company will care one bit if that's something you can do, what they will care about is how efficient you are. And I'm sorry but no matter how much you wanna fight it you can't outcompete a person that has integrated AI efficiently into their work.\n\nNow, there are companies that have not started diving into Ai, I know them, I've worked with them, and they are the ones that are lagging behind the competition. Sooner or later they will start caring about AI or die trying to fight it.\n\nIf you code for the fun of it that's fine, but if you want a job you absolutely MUST learn how to make AI a useful tool to remain competitive. As you said, yes, people will still be needed to maintain AIs but those people are using Ai the most too. There's no escape from it in the long run.",
