      "body": "Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.",

          "body": "For others thinking \"seems too good, what's the catch?\", got Gemini to give an opinion:\n\nHere are the \"catches\" hidden in the technical details of the paper:\n\n1. It is Not a \"Chatbot\" (Supervised, Not Generative)\n\nThis is the biggest difference. TRM is not a generative language model like GPT or Gemini.\n\n * The Catch: It is a supervised learning model. It is trained to receive an input (a puzzle) and provide a single deterministic correct answer.\n\n * Limitation: It cannot write a poem, summarize a text, or hold a conversation. It is designed specifically for tasks where there is a single, verifiable correct answer (like Sudoku or logical matrices), and currently cannot handle generative tasks with multiple valid answers.\n\n\n2. Training is Memory Heavy (OOM Risk)\n\nAlthough the model is \"tiny\" in terms of parameter count, the training process is costly regarding GPU RAM.\n\n * The Catch: Unlike HRM (which used mathematical shortcuts/approximations to save memory), TRM performs backpropagation (calculating errors for learning) through the entire recursion process.\n\n * Limitation: The paper explicitly admits that increasing the number of recursions (n) too much quickly leads to Out Of Memory (OOM) errors. Table 3 shows that while HRM could handle deep recursion (n=6, T=6), TRM crashed with OOM errors at that depth. You have a small model, but you need powerful hardware to train it if you want it to \"think\" for many cycles.\n\n\n3. Sensitivity to Architecture (No \"One Size Fits All\")\nTRM does not work magically for everything with the same configuration. The author had to manually change the internal structure depending on the problem.\n\n * The Catch: For Sudoku, the best version of TRM replaced \"Self-Attention\" (standard in Transformers) with a simple linear MLP network, which improved accuracy by roughly 10%.\n\n * Limitation: However, this MLP version performed poorly on other tests like Maze and ARC-AGI (which have larger grids/contexts). You need to adjust the architecture manually; every choice is not guaranteed to be optimal for every dataset.\n\n\n4. The \"Small Data\" Scenario\n\nTRM's major victory occurs in a specific scenario where LLMs often fail: learning complex rules with very few examples.\n\n * The Catch: The success of TRM is partly because large models suffer from overfitting (memorizing instead of learning) when data is scarce (e.g., only ~1000 training examples).\n\n * Limitation: The paper suggests this advantage exists specifically because there is \"too little data\" for big models to work efficiently. In scenarios with trillions of data points (like LLM pre-training), the \"brute force\" of large models might still be necessary.\n\n\n5. Time Cost (Slow to Train)\n\nBeing \"tiny\" does not mean being instant. Due to deep recursion (thinking multiple times about the same data) and deep supervision:\n\n * The Catch: Training on the ARC-AGI dataset took around 3 days using 4 H100 GPUs (which is extremely powerful and expensive hardware).\n\n * Limitation: Increasing the recursion steps incurs \"massive slowdowns\". For a model with only 7M parameters, this is a disproportionately high amount of compute time.\n\n\nSummary\n\nTRM will not replace ChatGPT. The \"catch\" is that it proves that for pure, closed logical reasoning (puzzles, rigid math), it is much more efficient to train a small network to \"think in circles\" (recursion) many times than to use a giant network that tries to guess the answer in one go.",

      "body": "Hey there,\n\nI was watching a recent [Jared Henderson video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2vPs8ld4nU) where he's critiquing AI products that simulate deceased loved ones. He makes some compelling arguments, some of which I agree with.\n\nBut one claim of his got me thinking: he argues that even if an AI *had* become conscious, it would only ever be a facsimile of the relative, a replacement, not the actual person themselves. And this reminded me a bit of Derek Parfit's work on identity, namely [the teleporter problem. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox)\n\nIn it, Parfit eventually concludes that personal identity itself might not be what actually matters to us. That what we really care about is the psychological continuity of the person (i.e., their memories, values, patterns of thought, etc.). In theory, a perfect copy could have all of this. From the inside, for the copy, nothing has changed. And *if* psychological continuity really is the thing that matters, is \"replacement\" even the right word anymore?\n\nObviously, todays tech isn't quite there, but even still, I think its a fun philosophical question. Does the original/copy distinction actually matter to you? Or is there something about being the original that matters beyond continuity?",

Our consciousness was temporarily absent, and our neural connections have changed slightly. But we identify with our yesterday versions because we have memories of our past days. Memory is what carries personality across time and space. If a digital copy of my personality has a memory of my organic past and is self-aware, this new digital personality will be me. Many such copies can be made. They will all be me, but over time, they will accumulate differences and become distinct personalities with the same memory of their organic past. There is no mysticism or \"eternal problem\" here. The teletransportation paradox is easily resolved. It's a pseudo-paradox.",

Someone is responsible for cleaning data, someone for preparing hardware, someone for tweaking model, someone for architecture, etc.\n\nAnd if that's one team working on a test for a certain model, then you can make multiple teams working on tests for other models.\n\nAnd there's definitely a bottleneck with training models, more compute is equal to more training speed and capability to train bigger models. And that means more opportunity to test more and bigger versions faster.\n\nI assume the ability to train/run AI is the biggest factor in AI dominance. A lot of people think so, that's why there's basically an arms race between the US and China right now.",

      "body": "From the abstract:\n\nWe conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors\u2019 (including Nobel laureates, Booker Prize winners, and young emerging National Book Award finalists) diverse styles.\n\nIn blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert (MFA candidates from top U.S. writing programs) and lay readers (recruited via Prolific), AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity and writing quality but showed mixed results with lay readers.\n\nHowever, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual author\u2019s complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity and writing quality, with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects are robust under cluster-robust inference and generalize across authors and styles in author-level heterogeneity analyses.\n\nThe fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate versus 97% for in-context prompting) by state-of-the-art AI detectors.\n\nMediation analysis reveals this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., clich\u00b4e density) that penalize in-context outputs, altering the relationship between AI detectability and reader preference.\n\nWhile we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable novel length prose, the median fine-tuning and inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation.\n\nStudy: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13939](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13939)",

      "body": "# 2010\u20132013: Early Connections\n\n* Elon Musk had been funding AI research since the 2000s because he was already concerned that advanced AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.\n* In the early 2010s, he became friends with DeepMind founder **Demis Hassabis**, meeting through London tech and futurist circles.\n* Musk was an **early believer** in the DeepMind mission. In 2013, he personally invested in DeepMind\u2019s Series A round alongside Hassabis, Mustafa Suleyman, and Jaan Tallinn (Skype co-founder and prominent x-risk donor).\n* At the time, DeepMind was a small London startup (fewer than 50 employees) pioneering deep reinforcement learning\u2014famously training neural nets to beat human performance at Atari games using only raw pixel input.\n\n  \n\n\n# Late 2013 \u2013 Early 2014: The Secret Sale Process\n\n* By late 2013, DeepMind realized it needed **hundreds of millions of dollars** and vast compute resources to stay at the frontier of AI research.\n* The company quietly explored an acquisition.\n* Five serious bidders emerged: **Google**, **Facebook**, **Baidu**, **Elon Musk (personally, with Peter Thiel)**, and a mysterious \u201c**Plan West**,\u201d widely believed to be Musk\u2019s internal codename.\n* Musk\u2019s explicit goal was to **keep DeepMind independent** and aligned with long-term human interests.\n* He was deeply worried that **Larry Page / Google** held what he described as a **\u201ccavalier attitude\u201d toward AGI risk**. Musk later recalled Page accusing him of being *\u201cspeciesist\u201d* for believing humans should survive AGI.\n\n  \n\n\n# The Bidding War\n\n* The final battle came down to **Google vs. Elon Musk**.\n* Musk and allies reportedly offered **$500\u2013600 million**, promising independence and a powerful ethics board\u2014Musk wanted actual **veto rights** over potentially dangerous research.\n* Google\u2019s bid was slightly higher in cash (final deal reported between **$500\u2013650 million**) but came with a firm stance: **No outside control.** No external veto.\n* DeepMind chose Google in February 2014, mainly because:\n   * Google had unmatched compute resources and global engineering talent.\n   * Google agreed to create an **internal ethics and safety board**.\n   * Some founders were uncomfortable with Elon having personal control over the company.\n\n  \n\n\n# Musk\u2019s Reaction\n\n* Musk was **furious**, shocked, and profoundly worried about the future of AGI.\n* He saw DeepMind\u2019s sale to Google as humanity losing its best chance to keep frontier AI out of a single corporation\u2019s hands.\n* Almost immediately afterward, he co-founded **OpenAI in 2015** (with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, etc.) explicitly as a **counterweight to Google DeepMind**.\n* OpenAI\u2019s original mission statement heavily implied: **\u201cGoogle bought DeepMind. We don\u2019t trust their intentions.\u201d**\n* For years, Musk publicly stated that losing DeepMind to Google was one of the major triggers for both **OpenAI** and later **xAI**.\n\n  \n\n\n# Long-Term Fallout\n\n* DeepMind and OpenAI became bitter research rivals for the next decade.\n* Ironically, Musk later turned the same criticisms he once aimed at Google toward **OpenAI itself**\u2014especially after GPT-4, the Microsoft partnership, and OpenAI\u2019s shift away from its fully open, non-profit roots.\n* In 2023, Musk founded **xAI** and launched **Grok**, explicitly framing it as a third competitor to what he called the **Google\u2013OpenAI duopoly**.\n\n  \n\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Elon Musk was an early investor, friend, and admirer of DeepMind.\n* In 2014, he made a serious attempt to **buy DeepMind** to keep it independent and safe.\n* He **lost to Google**, a moment he has said repeatedly \u201cterrified\u201d him.\n* That loss directly motivated the creation of **OpenAI (2015)** and later **xAI (2023)**.\n\n# In Musk\u2019s own words:\n\n&gt;\n\n  \n\n\nThat single failed deal in 2014 is one of the major butterfly-effect moments that shaped today\u2019s entire AI ecosystem.",

      "body": "\"The Bitter Lesson\" is a simple observation in AI: clever human heuristics always get crushed by dumber methods that just use more compute.\n-&gt; More data, more compute, \"number go up.\" \ud83d\udcc8\n\nAnd yet, current LLMs aren't really discovering new knowledge. They're compressing ours.\n\nThey are sophisticated mirrors, trained on human text, human thoughts, and human limitations. And a mirror can't see further than the thing it's reflecting.\n\nAn LLM that \"invents\" a new Physics concept has no way to know if it's true or just a coherent hallucination. There is no verification. No ground truth.\n\nWe've actually solved this problem before, in games: AlphaZero became superhuman at chess not by studying grandmasters, but by playing against itself. It discovered strategies unknown to man. And why did it work? Because chess has a verification signal: You win, or you lose.\n\nHere is the kicker: An LLM can't \"win\" a debate about quantum mechanics. It can't \"lose\" a hypothesis about dark matter.\n\nThis is why everyone in AI is betting on robotics: To break through the ceiling of human intelligence, AI needs a body. It needs to run experiments in the real world. Touch things. Break things. Learn from consequences.\n\nThis is the thesis behind Tesla Optimus: Fleet learning that can access physical ground truth.\n\nIf we build systems that can learn from physical reality, scale indefinitely, share knowledge instantly, and don't decay... then the human substrate becomes the bottleneck.\n\nWe are slow. We forget. We can't easily transfer what we learn. And we are facing a demographic crisis: Raising kids is hard. People care about lifestyle. Korea's fertility rate is at 0.8, way below the replacement rate. Japan and Europe are following.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't a failure. Perhaps our biology is just the bootloader?\n\nToward what? Most people say: \"Maximize intelligence. Spread across the cosmos.\" But that's not an answer. That\u2019s just a function.\n\nWhat matters isn't whether a mind runs on carbon or silicon. What matters is that someone is home. Something that looks at the stars, wonders, and asks \"why\".\n\nThe machines are not replacing humanity. They are continuing the story.\n\nWe are building vessels that can carry the spark of consciousness further than biology ever could.\n\nWe don't get to decide the purpose for future minds. We just keep the door open.\n\nCarbon or silicon. Organic or synthetic. These are implementation details.\n\nThe thing that asks \"why\", this is what we need to protect.\n",

Last week I could, but now, unless I\u2019m browsing an AI sub, or see the /r/, I don\u2019t know if I could trust my instincts to catch that something could be AI. I mean I see crappy quality real photos that I just inherently trust. Now AI even has that esthetic in some. I feel like the moment so many have talked about is here. \n\nHow do I trust anything I don\u2019t see first hand anymore? I will concede that video gen has a ways to go, but images still carry a lot of weight. How should we navigate this and not end up like a bunch of flat-earther conspiracy theorists that only believe their own immediate perspective? ",
